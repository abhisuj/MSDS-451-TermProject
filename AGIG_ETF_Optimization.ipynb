        "The previous execution of `create_features` resulted in an empty DataFrame (`features_and_target_df.shape: (0, 510)`). This is likely due to the aggressive `dropna()` call removing all rows because some tickers in `PORTFOLIO_TICKERS` have significant missing historical data, especially after applying lookback-period indicators and `shift(-1)` for targets. To fix this, I need to make the `create_features` function more robust by filtering out tickers with excessive missing data before feature engineering and ensure consistent data handling for the remaining tickers. This revised code block implements these checks and filtering logic.\n",

I need to explicitly drop the initial rows corresponding to the lookback window from the features DataFrame and the trailing NaN from the target DataFrame *before* concatenation. This ensures that `dropna()` on the combined DataFrame only removes truly unresolvable missing data, rather than expected initial/final NaNs, yielding a non-empty result.\n",

To resolve this, I will modify the `create_features` function to explicitly drop any feature or target columns that are entirely `NaN` after their initial calculation. Additionally, I will ensure that the `target_df` columns are aligned with the remaining `features_df` columns before concatenation, preventing any mismatches that could lead to an empty combined DataFrame after `dropna()` by introducing extra `NaN`s.\n",

        "The `PortfolioOptimizationProblem` class and the optimization execution loop were successfully updated to integrate the predicted covariance matrix from the Bi-LSTM model. The flattened model output was reshaped into a 30x30 matrix for each test period, and this dynamic covariance matrix replaced the static historical calculation in the optimization process.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "*   The Bi-LSTM model successfully predicted 585 sets of scaled returns and 585 sets of flattened covariances. These were inverse transformed into `predicted_simple_returns` (shape: 585, 30) and `predicted_covariances_flattened` (shape: 585, 465).\n",
        "*   A helper function `flattened_to_cov_matrix` successfully reconstructed 585 individual 30x30 symmetric covariance matrices from the flattened predictions.\n",
        "*   The `PortfolioOptimizationProblem` class was modified to dynamically use the appropriate predicted covariance matrix (`predicted_cov_matrices_time_series`) for each test period within its `_evaluate` method, replacing the prior static covariance.\n",
        "*   The NSGA-II optimization algorithm successfully executed with the updated problem definition, utilizing the time-series of predicted covariance matrices to generate Pareto-optimal portfolios, with `cv_min` converging to 0.\n",
        "*   The optimization generated a Pareto front of optimal portfolios, including their returns, dividends, volatility, CVaR, and Sharpe ratios, which were also visualized.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   The successful integration of dynamic, predicted covariance matrices marks a significant improvement in the portfolio optimization framework, allowing for more responsive risk management based on forward-looking predictions rather than historical averages.\n",
        "*   Further analysis could involve comparing the performance of portfolios optimized with predicted covariances against those using historical or other forecasting methods, potentially through backtesting.\n"
